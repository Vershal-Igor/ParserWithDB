Something else
On top of the basic cache API function, it has some additional capabilities that is attractive for building large scale enterprise applications. The API is based on a Java Map (Hashtable) Interface. It is based on a key/value store semantics where the value can be any Java Serializable object. Coherence allows multiple cache identified by a unique name (which they called a "named cache"). The common usage pattern is to locate a cache by its name, and then act on the cache.
