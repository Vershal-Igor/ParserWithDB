    <articles title="Hibernate ORM 5.2.11.Final User Guide: Introduction" author="UNKNOWN" contents="Working with both Object-Oriented software and Relational Databases can be cumbersome and time consuming. Development costs are significantly higher due to a paradigm mismatch between how data is represented in objects versus relational databases. Hibernate is an Object/Relational Mapping solution for Java environments. The term Object/Relational Mapping refers to the technique of mapping data from an object model representation to a relational data model representation (and visa versa).Hibernate not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities. It can significantly reduce development time otherwise spent with manual data handling in SQL and JDBC. Hibernate’s design goal is to relieve the developer from 95% of common data persistence-related programming tasks by eliminating the need for manual, hand-crafted data processing using SQL and JDBC. However, unlike many other persistence solutions, Hibernate does not hide the power of SQL from you and guarantees that your investment in relational technology and knowledge is as valid as always. Hibernate may not be the best solution for data-centric applications that only use stored-procedures to implement the business logic in the database, it is most useful with object-oriented domain models and business logic in the Java-based middle-tier. However, Hibernate can certainly help you to remove or encapsulate vendor-specific SQL code and will help with the common task of result set translation from a tabular representation to a graph of objects."/>

    <articles title="Spring Framework - Overview" author="UNKNOWN" contents="Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code. Spring framework is an open source Java platform. It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003. Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of Spring framework is around 2MB. The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model."/>

    <articles title="The Java Platform module system" author="Sander Mak" contents="The defining feature for Java 9 is an all-new module system. When codebases grow larger, the odds of creating complicated, tangled “spaghetti code” increase exponentially. There are two fundamental problems: It is hard to truly encapsulate code, and there is no notion of explicit dependencies between different parts (JAR files) of a system. Every public class can be accessed by any other public class on the classpath, leading to inadvertent usage of classes that weren't meant to be public API. Furthermore, the classpath itself is problematic: How do you know whether all the required JARs are there, or if there are duplicate entries? The module system addresses both issues.Modular JAR files contain an additional module descriptor. In this module descriptor, dependencies on other modules are expressed through`requires` statements. Additionally, `exports` statements control which packages are accessible to other modules. All non-exported packages are encapsulated in the module by default."/>
    <articles title="UNKNOWN" author="Thorben Janssen" contents="Fetching multiple entities by their ID is a very common use case. Most developers either implement it with a loop that calls the find method of the EntityManager for each primary key or with a JPQL query that checks all primary key values in an IN clause. The first option requires Hibernate to perform a database query for each primary key. That can create huge performance issues. The second one allows you to fetch all entities with one query and is obviously the better option. Hibernate 5.1 introduced a third option that avoids the issues of the first and is easier to use than the second one. The new MultiIdentifierLoadAccess interface provides a comfortable option to load multiple entities with one query. You just need to call the byMultipleIds method on the Hibernate Session to get a MultiIdentifierLoadAccess interface and provide a list of primary key values to the multiLoad method."/>
    <articles title="What are the most exciting features that are expected to be released in Java 9" author="Alex Zhitnitsky" contents="Don’t get distracted by the relative silence around Java 9! The JDK committers are hard at work preparing the next release, which is expected to be generally available in September 2017. Early access builds are already out in the wild and we’re counting down the days for general availability on the Java 9 Countdown website. Today we have a pretty clear picture of the features we can expect in Java 9. If Java 8 could be described as the major release of lambdas, streams and API changes, then Java 9 is all about Jigsaw, jshell, and a collection of under the hood and API updates. In this post we’ve gathered some of the features we believe are the most exciting ones that are targeting Java 9 – Apart from the usual suspect, project Jigsaw, which took on the mission of breaking down the JRE and bringing modularity to Java’s core components."/>
